**EE-Central.io** is a community-driven project addressing
the challenges of the adoption and integration of new enterprise Java technologies.footnote:[Oracle and Java are registered trademarks of Oracle and/or its affiliates.

It aims to provide a clear adoption/migration path, recommended usage, and strong focus on enablement
and innovation. Furthermore, it attempts to provide a common ground for all community efforts to enhance
current specifications and to help move future versions of Java EE platform forward.
The community will find a large and growing variety of resources enabling them
to quickly improve their Java EE knowledge and adopt future technologies related to Java EE.

The Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) specification is one of the most important enterprise
middleware specifications of the past 3 decades. With broad and deep vendor adoption,
particularly within the open source community, Java EE implementations are used more widely
in vertical sectors than any other enterprise technology,
because it provides standards on assemblies and deployment, local and remote endpoints,
object management with dependencies, with transactions, concurrency, persistence, messaging and dynamic web content.

Although Oracle owns the Java brand (after they acquired Sun Microsystems),
Java EE has always been the product of multiple vendor and community collaborations:

- Vendors, such as IBM, Red Hat and Oracle itself
- Open source foundations, such as Eclipse and the Apache Software Foundation
- Java User Groups, such as SouJava and the London Java Community (LJC)
- And many individuals

Oracle, and Sun before them, lead the umbrella Java EE Platform Java Specification Request (JSR)
and many of the components within it, such as JTA (transactions), JMS (messaging) and JAX-RS (REST).
However, other vendors, foundations, or individuals lead other Java EE related JSRs or are actively involved in them.

Several top-tier leaders in the enterprise technology community believe Java EE has a strong future,
beyond even the traditional enterprise Java market. However, we have seen periods of stagnation
in the evolution of Java EE specifications, when the vendors were not able to respond to modern trends quickly enough.
The risks of slowing the progress on future specifications and hence their adoption is high -- not only for vendors,
but also for all the businesses that have investments in related technologies.
Our community believes we have to find new ways to accelerate the innovation and development of new technologies
for enterprise Java applications to ensure this future. This group intends to pull together as a community
and foster an environment to create such innovations. We strongly hope that Oracle and other vendors acknowledge
that this activity is essential in helping to fill the gaps in the Java EE ecosystem.

Java technologies for enterprise applications have a critical role to play in the coming years.
Java EE, unlike its predecessor J2EE, already offers lightweight and modular runtimes,
which support modern paradigms, such as microservices, modular applications, and reactive architectures.
**New and innovative Java technologies, such as polyglot integration and cloud enablement,
designed for robust, enterprise applications have a great potential to enhance the current offerings.
They promise to further increase the productivity in newly evolving areas such as mobile, cloud,
and the Internet of Things (IoT).**

Therefore, in a similar manner to the http://www.adoptajsr.org[Adopt a JSR^] program,
the aims are to encourage JUG members, individuals, corporations, and other organizations
to get involved in Java EE JSRs where the work is best done when enhancing existing
Java EE specifications.  This means more grass roots, developer level participation
in Java EE specifications.
In addition to helping continue to drive Java EE JSRs, one pragmatic aim of the group
is to introduce resources such as:

- Quickstarts
- Tutorials
- Maven and build archetypes
- Screencasts
- Reference architectures
- Videos
- Training references
- And much more

All together with the above resources, our work focuses on frameworks, tools and architectural
designs for improving developer productivity when building modern applications using Java EE.
The combination of Java EE and these additional resources will grow the community,
improve developer efficiency, and provide technical capabilities that address modern application
requirements -- all with a cohesive architectural approach.

= Java EE Progress

For months, those of us very close to the Java Community
Process (JCP) have noticed a marked slowdown in development
on Java EE 8 JSRs led by Oracle. Indeed there have been many
anecdotes of Oracle specification leads themselves stating
that they are unable to make adequate progress on Java EE
standardization work. We will try to avoid citing those instances
specifically to protect these good people at Oracle. Thanks to
the openness of the JCP, we can now demonstrate what is clearly
happening using objective publicly available data [footnote:
Java EE JSRs are operated in the open and all Java EE reference
implementations today are open source. Expert group user alias
email activity, JIRA issue activity and open source commit
activity are all archived and publicly available on java.net
and GitHub].

Oracle had already acknowldged a significant delay shipping
Java EE 8 [link: https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/entry/java_ee_8_roadmap_update].
This meant that Java EE 8 would take longer than Java EE 7
despite being far more limited in scope. As you’ll see below
if the current pattern of inactivity holds, even that delayed
release date looks severely unrealistic.

As a first important step we have already included data and analysis
for some key Java EE 8 JSRs below. We will continue to add the data
for more Java EE 8 JSRs as quickly as we can. The general pattern
of inactivity is very similar across Oracle led Java EE 8 JSRs and
already pretty clear in the JSR analysis we have below. These
patterns will only strengthen as we add data for more and more
JSRs, so please check back on this section periodically.

== Java EE

The umbrella specification itself is the first being underworked.
If you compare the activity of the Java EE mailing list through
history, you will notice a decrease:

* Java EE 6 (jsr-316-eg@jcp.org) : 195 threads of discussion (that’s a few thousands emails exchange)
* Java EE 7 (jsr342-experts@javaee-spec.java.net) : 177 threads of discussion
* Java EE 8 (jsr366-experts@javaee-spec.java.net) : 28 threads of discussion so far

== JSF

The image below shows the number of emails to the expert group
alias by Oracle specification leads. Emails are the principal
means the JCP expert group collaborates through and specification
lead emails are critical since they are the key decision makers.
As can be clearly seen, JSF starts on a strong note but levels
off consistently as time progresses.

The picture becomes even clearer when we look at the number of
JIRA issue resolutions by Oracle. As can be seen there is a
sudden sharp drop of activity after October 2015 - the general
trend is downward after a strong start.

The same pattern is further crystallized when we look at the number of code
commits from Oracle.

Here is the current declared schedule for JSF:

* Early Draft - Q4 2015
* Public Review - Q1 2016
* Proposed Final Draft - Q3 2016
* Final Release - H1 2017

The early draft date was met in October 2015 before the sudden
drop in activity accurred. The public review draft is due in just
a month but because of the lack of activity no progress towards it
has happened which means JSF is now already behind by close to four
months and things are getting worse as time presses on.

== Servlet

The situation for the critical Servlet specification is very
worrisome. For perspective the Servlet 3.1 specification was a
minor update to the 3.0 specification. Servlet 4 by comparison
is the most significant update to the specification in many
years - bringing standard HTTP/2 support to server-side Java
developers. Given these facts we should expect significantly
higher levels of activity in Servlet 4 as compared with
Servlet 3.1. As we can see from the data for emails from
Oracle specification leads as well as the number of issue
resolutions, the opposite is happening. Activity was low to
begin with by comparison to 3.1 and getting even lower as
time presses on. In both graphs there is a very short-lived
sudden spike representing work done to produce the early draft
during the October 2015 time frame.

The same pattern is further crystallized when we look at the
number of artifact commits from Oracle. Commits to the
specification are essentially down by 50% compared with
Servlet 3.1. Indeed approximately 40% of the total commits
for Servlet 4 was in October of 2015. Activity dropped off
after that and there has been only 1 commit in the last
four months.

Here is the current declared schedule for Servlet:

* Early Draft - Q4 2015
* Public Review - Q1 2016
* Proposed Final Draft - Q3 2016
* Final Release - H1 2017

The early draft date was met in October 2015 as is reflected
by the very brief spike in activity. The public review draft
is due in just a month but because of the lack of activity a
timely public review is highly unlikely. Servlet is likely
behind by close to five/six months and things are getting
worse as time presses on.

== JMS

The situation for JMS is quite a bit worse. Activity in the
specification was very meager all along and is now at a complete
deadstop. Comparing data for JMS 2 and JMS 2.1 so far tells a
very crystal clear story.

Here is the current declared schedule for JMS:

* Early Draft - Q4 2015
* Public Review - Q1 2016grvkm
* Proposed Final Draft - Q3 2016
* Final Release - H1 2017

The early draft date was met in October 2015 as is reflected by
the very brief spike in activity for JMS 2.1. The public review
draft is due in just a month but because of the total lack of
activity a timely public review is highly unlikely. JMS is
likely behind by close to five/six months and things are getting
worse as time presses on.

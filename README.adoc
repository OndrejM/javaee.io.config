Site pages are configured by files in `pages` folder. They can be in any markup supported by GitHub, but we adoc format is preferred.

=== Page configuration files

A page is configured by:

 - markup file (e.g. `.adoc`) - it defines the page body and name
 - yaml file (e.g. `.adoc.yaml`) - it has the same name as the markup file plus `.yaml`, defines additional attributes of the page in yaml format

Yaml configuration contains:

- h1 - main header of the page
- h2 - secondary (longer) header of the page

=== ADOC syntax specific

==== Links to other pages

When referring to another page, always use external links, such as `\link:mission.adoc[JavaEE.io]`. Otherwise the links will not work in the application.
